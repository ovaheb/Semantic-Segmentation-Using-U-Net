# Semantic Segmentation Using U-Net
 
In this project, I wrote codes to do semantic segmentation using U-Net on Cam Vid dataset. The U-Net network is a network designed to perform Semantic Segmentation on Medical data. In this network, using convolutional layers and then using Up Sampling, the features related to the context of the image are extracted and by combining the features and feature maps extracted in each step, the local and Context information is combined.
